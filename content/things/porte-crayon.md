**On 9 April 1767, the following ad appeared in the French newspaper** *Annonces, affiches et avis divers:* “Lost on the 25<sup>th</sup> March between the Stock Exchange and Château Trompette, *an emerald shagreen-covered CASE* [*ÉTUI*] *containing a pair of compasses, a porte-crayon and a* [folding] *set-square in silver, on which is inscribed “by Butterfield.”* The person who finds it is begged to return it to the hand of M. Perronneau, Peintre du Roi, Place du Marché Royal, at M. Lagarde’s.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. [The finder] will receive a reward of 12 livres.”[^1] Never, arguably, had the *porte-crayon* (chalk holder) been more present to Perronneau than in its absence and more consciously tangible than in this moment of loss.[^2] Though translated above idiomatically as “to the hand of M. Perronneau,” literally, he begged for its return to “his grasp,” that he might hold it again. Perronneau, a Paris portrait painter in {% thing 'pastel' %} and in oil, was on a working tour to Bordeaux when his pencil case went missing. It was not his first trip to this thriving inland Atlantic city and port on the river Garonne in the southwestern province of Guyenne and Gascony. The port was second only to Nantes in the volume and importance of its trade in sugar, tobacco, and slaves with Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti). The city had grown rapidly in the early eighteenth century, and the neighborhood between the medieval castle Trompette and Ange-Jacques Gabriel’s new Stock Exchange, where Perronneau lost his pencil case, was fashionable and home to the mansions of the city’s premier merchants. On the other side of the Exchange was the Place du Marché Royale, where Perronneau lodged; built in 1760, it was the focus of the similarly well-to-do *quartier* Saint-Pierre. The prosperity and salubriousness of the city notwithstanding, Perronneau was nevertheless perhaps more vulnerable to misadventure away from home, and certainly more sensitive to the pain of it.

Although highly conventionalized forms of writing, lost-property ads are nevertheless first-person narratives. In this sense, they resemble the personal avowals of possession found in letters, {% thing 'journals' %}, and holograph {% thing 'wills' %}, rather than public statements of ownership made by notaries and dealers in inventories and sale catalogs. However, in contrast to Charles-Nicolas Cochin’s invocation of the ideal {% thing 'handkerchief' %} in his letters to a friend, Perronneau’s description is *d’après nature*, an immediate, detailed account of the salient features of that which was and was already his. Unlike Jean-Baptiste Massé’s {% thing 'will' %}, it frames his thing in a narrative of dispossession rather than voluntary separation or giving. He tells where and when he lost it but reveals nothing of the object’s biography and how the *porte-crayon* came to be his. A paradoxical genre, the lost-property ad combines anguished expression of displaced ownership with objective description of surface appearance. To reconnect the two, we first need to know more about this thing before, in a second move, reconstructing its value via the text’s discourse of possession and the particular circumstances of Perronneau’s life.

According to Patrick Rocca and Françoise Launay, silver drawing instruments were relatively rare. They are recorded in only 1 to 5 percent of probate inventories in the period between 1680 and 1780, the golden age of silver drawing sets.[^3] Brass was standard for such things.[^4] The form of the *porte-crayon*, however, did not vary significantly with the material. It consisted of a hollow cylinder with two rings. The cylinder was slit at either end in order to render it sufficiently flexible to receive the sticks of chalk inserted into it. These were held tightly in place by the grip of the rings, once slid down over the cylinder and chalk.[^5] The only observable difference between silver and brass *porte-crayons* was that silver ones tend to be smaller and were generally fashioned to hold chalk at one end only.[^6] The precious metal added nothing to the functionality of the tool.[^7]

Inherently valuable, Perronneau’s set was also expertly made. “Butterfield” was Michael Butterfield, an Englishman who had moved to Paris in the mid-1660s to become, according to Anthony Turner, one of the most important scientific instrument makers in Paris in the last quarter of the seventeenth century.[^8] Inventor of the so-called Butterfield dial (a pocket sun dial) and supplier of astronomical instruments to the Royal Observatory, drawing instruments were the bread-and-butter business of his workshop ({% ref 'fig-134' %}).[^9] Since Butterfield died in 1724, Perronneau must have acquired his instruments second-hand.[^10] By contrast, the case in which he kept them was very likely new. Shagreen, or fish leather, scraped and dyed to reveal its characteristically dotted dermal pattern, only became fashionable in the 1750s, when developed and marketed by the Paris glover Jean-Claude Galluchat.[^11] Shagreen was pretty but valued also for its practicality. Tougher than animal leather and waterproof, it provided an ideal outer skin for containers of all kinds. Perronneau’s green speckled case may have been stock, but it was more likely bespoke because his instruments were few and the set incomplete; even the smallest sets included a ruler.[^12] In sum, though drawing sets were standardized commodities by the end of the seventeenth century, there was little that was standard about Perronneau’s.

The painter put a price on its return. What did 12 livres represent? Not the cost of replacement, to judge by the silver drawing sets made and sold by the Paris instrument maker Jacques Canivet on the Quai de l’École. The stock inventoried at his death in 1773 included sets of silver drawing instruments valued at half the price of Perronneau’s reward.[^13] Not its exchange value either, since used goods generally sold for less than new.[^14] What 12 livres represented had less to do with the market than with the material form of the currency. Rewards were paid in cash, and values were therefore determined by the denominations of coin. Twelve livres represented the account value of a demi-louis, the smallest of the gold coins in circulation in the eighteenth century. According to the *Affiches*, it potentially bought back pocketbooks, seals, walking sticks, and handbags.[^15] If the reward appears roughly commensurate with the value of things lost, it is, however, an illusion because, as Jonathan Lamb points out, “reward” is by definition excessive.[^16] Loss does not alienate property, and buying it back is a legal and commercial nonsense since ownership is not transferred. The value of the reward Perronneau promised the one who returned his pencil case thus indexed not its exchange value but the feelings he had for his drawing instruments, their sentimental value, and the desire he had for their restoration that he might enjoy holding them once again.

That Perronneau treasured his *porte-crayon* might seem surprising. He was not an artist reputed as a draftsman. Few autonomous drawings by his hand survive, and unlike his rival, Maurice-Quentin de La Tour, he does not appear routinely to have made preparatory drawings for his {% thing 'pastel' %} portraits.[^17] Rather, he did the preliminary line work for his pastels directly on the support. Sketched lines mapping the relative positions of Olivier Journu’s temple, hairline, and chin are just discernible under infrared light in the 1756 portrait ({% ref 'fig-135' %}) of this sugar and slave trader, which Perronneau had painted on an earlier visit to Bordeaux.[^18] Merchant families in the sugar business feature prominently in Perronneau’s patronage circle, the Journu among others.[^19] The painter may have used his *porte-crayon* on Journu, but the lines of underdrawing are broad, their application seemingly rapid and sweeping, consistent with chalk gripped, like sticks of {% thing 'pastel' %}, directly between the fingers rather than mediated by a holder.

The pencil case and loss of it in the street suggest that the *porte-crayon* was for drawing *en pleine société* (to adapt the phrase *en plein air*), not in the studio. It was, in this sense, part of the paraphernalia of sociability and social representation that made up the bulk of the lost property that owners sought to entice home by reward: medals, pocket {% thing 'watches' %}, fancy bags, and {% thing 'snuffboxes' %}.[^20] A rare portrait drawing by Perronneau of the Dutch collector Louis Metayer Phzn ({% ref 'fig-136' %}), dated circa 1767–68, at the time the painter visited Amsterdam, represents the kind of refined and detailed portrait drawing that Charles-Nicolas Cochin had made fashionable as a social pastime among friends at Mme Geoffrin’s salon in the 1750s.[^21] The control and refinement of the lines indicate that the *porte-crayon* has been active. Attentiveness and delicacy, attributes of Perronneau’s graphic gesture, found their correlates in polite social intercourse, thereby commending drawing as a polite art.

Where does that leave the *porte-crayon*? Answer: as only indirectly the subject of this inquiry? Its thingly claims to our attention having been drowned out by the voice of the subject? Reducing the *porte-crayon* to the status of object sign of Perronneau’s artistic ego does not, however, account fully for the painter’s distress at losing it. Steven Fowles has noted that things obtrude in consciousness not only when they break or malfunction but also when they disappear.[^22] Lost things prey on our minds. They have material effects, leaving painful holes in our selves.[^23] The announcement to the world in the newspaper of the depleted subject, self minus thing, was a cry for restoration of not only lost property but also the unity of self. If Perronneau selected chalk only occasionally as a medium for his art, he more regularly seems to have signed his pastels using graphite, very possibly manipulated into elegant cursive lines by his silver *porte-crayon*.[^24] The artist Perronneau minus *porte-crayon* was, in his mind, and perhaps in the opinion of others, not just an artist with an incomplete tool set but,d simply and more significantly, not quite an artist at all.[^25] {% contributors context=pageContributors format='symbol' %}
