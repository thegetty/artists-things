**A rare green silk umbrella** ([fig. 170](#fig.-170)) is one of the eighteenth-century treasures of the Palais Galliera, the Paris museum of fashion. It has a turned oak handle, an eight-rib hinged metal frame, and a retracting and divisible central pole to enable the close and collapse of the umbrella into a pocketable thing ([fig. 171](#fig.-171)). Although the framework of the umbrella was sometimes made of other materials (wood, baleen), the structure of this type of umbrella was generic to both umbrellas and parasols, which differed, when they did, only in the stuff of the canopy.[^1] A close taffeta weave was the choice treatment, for resistance to sun and rain, and for pliable stiffness. The cloth was sometimes given additional proofing by a coat of gum, oil, or wax, though eighteenth-century dictionary definitions suggest that a distinction was not thereby routinely made between umbrellas (*parapluies*) and parasols.[^2]

The telescopic mechanism of the Galliera umbrella was of a type invented and patented by purse maker Jean Marius at the beginning of the eighteenth century, for the umbrella-parasols he sold at his shop, *The Three Funnels*, on Rue des Fossés Saint-Germain.[^3] It transformed the parasol from a heavy and cumbersome object, permanently open and used by the elite on ceremonial occasions, into an every-rainy-day consumer item for every day, or every rainy day.[^4] Competition for control of the rapidly expanding market for collapsible umbrellas after Marius’s patent expired in 1715 was vigorously conducted by members of three guilds: the turners, licensed by statute to make the wooden handles; the purse makers, who, as depicted in the *Encyclopédie* ([see fig. 171](#fig.-171)), cut wire for the ribs and sewed gores of stuff to the frame for the canopy; and the petty mercers of incidentals and accessories, or *peigneurs-tabletiers*, who enjoyed the legal right to sell them. The ultimate victors were the *peigneurs-tabletiers*, some of whom began in the 1760s to specialize in umbrella vending, becoming *marchands de parasols*. Their stock continued to be supplied by turners and purse makers, for the sticks and canopies, but the petty mercers were able to organize their subcontracting on a scale large enough to drive down unit cost and thereby the price of umbrellas. According to Cissie Fairchilds’s calculations, by 1785 over 30 percent of lower- and middle-income households in Paris owned an umbrella or parasol.[^5] The engraver and highly successful print seller and publisher Jacques-Philippe Le Bas was among them.[^6] A “green parasol,” very possibly resembling the one at Galliera, was listed at his death in his probate inventory; it was in a cupboard in his bedroom, on the first floor of a house he rented on Rue du Foin-Saint-Jacques.[^7]

For Fairchilds, the significance of the umbrella is the part it played in the consumer revolution that transformed the urban economy and, in turn, destabilized the social hierarchy of the ancien régime. She brackets umbrellas with fans, {% thing 'snuffboxes' %}, stockings, {% thing 'teacups' %}, and gold {% thing 'watches' %}, under the heading of “populuxe” goods—cheap copies of aristocratic luxury items, desired, she argues, not for their utility, but rather for the touch of class they added to working-class and bourgeois lives. Le Bas’s things, as inventoried in 1783, seem to confirm her findings. Among them were a porcelain {% thing 'snuffbox' %}, a London-made gold {% thing 'watch' %}, and a china tea set. Moreover, his wardrobe was exceptionally fashionable; it included fine linen, cotton and silk stockings, lace cuffs, silver buckles, gold buttons, and a gold-knobbed cane (perhaps the one depicted by Moreau the Younger in his {% thing 'sketchbook' %}).[^8] However, the fashionable picture this acquisitiveness appears to paint of Le Bas does not entirely chime with the contemporary biographies of the engraver, or rather his lives challenge the presumption of many histories of consumption, that rises in luxury spending were inspired by social ambition and personal pleasure and expressed a modern kind of individualism.

Though Le Bas was an academician, indeed elected one of the Académie’s councilors in 1771, the authors of his lives belonged to the print trade and were not “amateur” members of the Académie or professional men of letters, as was usually the case with the biographers of painters and sculptors. François-Charles Joullain, a printmaker and art dealer, wrote two lives of Le Bas: a formal historical biography published with the sale catalog of Le Bas’s collection and stock in 1783, and an informal and unpublished life inserted at the beginning of the Oeuvre of Le Bas that he compiled and donated in 1789 to the royal library.[^9]

What sets these texts apart from those written for the Académie’s *Conférences* is the license Joullain took, on the basis of his direct and close knowledge of his subject, to multiply the number of personal “anecdotes.”[^10] When such miscellaneous facts (*faits divers*) feature in academic lives they exemplify and endorse the ideal image of the artist as learned, naturally gifted, or, in private life, modest and disinterested.[^11] In Joullain’s lives, however, things are not in the service of such literary tropes but nor are they things in themselves. Rather, they serve as the occasion and stuff of social relationships, often structuring the brief narratives of the anecdotes: the set of clothes given him by his mother, an impoverished widow, the moment he leaves home on life’s adventure, the jewels he bestowed on Elisabeth Duret to secure her hand and which he sold in a crisis shortly after the wedding day.[^12] Even seemingly trivial and inconsequential transactions embody enduring social bonds: Le Bas’s offer of his coat for Chardin’s *Still Life with a Hare* (1728–29, New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art) is vividly reported as a favor, mutually felt, cementing a lifelong friendship.[^13]

When Joullain does invoke the semantic value of objects as signs of distinction, they challenge the official history of the noble order of academic artists with their “low history” (*petite histoire*) of unpretending talent. Dress illustrates Le Bas’s refusal to stand on ceremony. Apparently, on memorable occasions the engraver served at the counter in his shop, greeting his elite customers in shirtsleeves and cap.[^14] In fact Joullain reserved his most colorful and surprising anecdotes to illustrate Le Bas’s radical egalitarianism, his insistence on engaging with the world on terms of equality, grounded in talent, not rank or birth.[^15]

What bearing does this have on Le Bas’s umbrella? It suggests that although the low cost of its materials and manufacture and the cheap market price qualified it as *populuxe* by Fairchilds’s criteria, its attraction for Le Bas was not necessarily its agency as an index of status. If the umbrella signified class, it is not clear that it did so unequivocally: Louis-Antoine, the marquis de Caraccioli, remarked in 1768 that in Paris the umbrella was “the sign of having *no* {% thing 'carriage' %}” and of having to walk on foot. Consequently, it was shunned by those of rank and title, who willingly took the risk of getting wet rather than be “confounded with the vulgar.”[^16] Joullain does not directly connect Le Bas and the umbrella but he does associate him with the urban street, the prime location, as Le Bas’s own etching of a peddler ([fig. 172](#fig.-172)) in François Boucher’s *Cris de Paris* indicates, of their sale and use.[^17] In one anecdote, Le Bas plays the jealous husband, pursuing his wife, whom he wrongly suspects of infidelity, in a taxi (*fiacre*); disillusioned and humiliated, he returns home in the rain, sopping and mud-spattered, presumably having left his umbrella in the cab, or forgotten it in his haste.[^18] Le Bas’s identity was, according to Joullain, grounded in the neighborhood street, specifically Rue de La Harpe, where he lived for forty-seven years, the address inscribed on the vast majority of the prints he published.[^19] “I have seen him,” writes Joullain, “magnificently dressed, stopping at the shop of a craftsman, or waylaying common folk in the middle of the road, either to buy from them things he did not need, and which he later gave away to others, or to ask them about themselves, their circumstances, their family, and their needs. [The street] provided him with manifold opportunities for benevolence.”[^20] Silver buckles, gold buttons, and a collapsible umbrella were not, in Joullain’s discourse, the glittery trappings of upward social mobility, but symptoms\` of the generosity he extended to himself and to others.

Joullain’s biographies of Le Bas manifestly draw on tropes and themes from the literature of *sensibilité*, and some of the things mentioned in the lives function as sentimental objects whose personal meaning transcends its material and economic value: the portrait of Le Bas’s mother, for example, before which, according to Joullain, Le Bas regularly shed the tears of a dutiful son, throughout his life.[^21] However, what distinguishes Le Bas’s umbrella from things recorded and valued as commodities in his inventory, and also from those objects that manifestly serve as touchstones of private emotion in the biographies, is the umbrella’s materiality and dependence on the human to bring it to life. Umbrellas require skill and dexterity. Once opened up, they invite the freedom to venture forth in all weather, the opportunity to extend relief and hospitality to others under the intimate circumference of their cover. Human and thing become entangled in networks of material and social relations.

It is of course possible that the confinement of the green parasol in Le Bas’s bedroom cupboard indicates a forgotten or discarded thing, not one kept handy, or, that it had originally belonged to Mme Le Bas and that the engraver cherished it as a keepsake. But Joullain’s relentless focus on the externalities of Le Bas’s life, on what connected him to family, friends, workshop, neighborhood, supports the argument here that the shape and rhythm of Le Bas’s life depended on the things that he took out into the world, his umbrella perhaps especially. It entrapped him into keeping his responsibilities and commitments and fulfilling his duties come rain or shine. {% contributors context=pageContributors format='symbol' %}

[^17]: That Le Bas identified himself with the street is suggested by his claim, reported by Joullain, that he had learned to read on the street, from the shop signs of Paris (“*L’oeuvre*” [Ee 11], iii) and that the memorial he cherished for himself was a series of distance markers on the road from Paris to Bicêtre with his prints posted upon them “so that passers-by are entertained and that they regret (the passing) of their author”(“afin que les Passans s’en amusent et plaignent leur auteur”).
