The petitioners justified their case principally on grounds of custom. The public passages had, they said, always been lit at night. “Decency requires it, and the good of all is united in it.”[^5] The Louvre was a community as well as a legally protected enclave. The king’s artists living there were, by an act of Henri IV in 1608, distinguished from the city’s ordinary painters and sculptors by privileges that included the freedom to practice their arts without let or hindrance from the Paris guilds and by exemptions from certain municipal taxes and duties, including taxes levied to pay for the lighting and cleaning of the city’s streets.[^6] At one level the passageway lanterns represented a sign of exceptionalism: royal lighting, we might say, as opposed to city lights. At another level and more importantly, the practice of lighting the passages played a part in fostering and sustaining a sense and style of community among the denizens of the Louvre.

The light shed would not have been as intense as that afforded by wax candles, but sufficient to vouchsafe “decency” in what the petitioners called their “gallery,” the passage connecting the *logements* at mezzanine level. By “décence” they meant that “exterior” or public expression of polite bearing,[^15] appropriate to spaces of prestige. By naming the mezzanine passageway the “small gallery” they implicitly invited comparison of it to the celebrated Grande Galerie above, and invoked an interior space of habitation and belonging as well as of convenient transit.[^16] In this passage-cum-gallery, the private space of individual studios and the public space of the palace and the greater world beyond collided. Hubert Robert’s gray-washed, black-chalk drawing of a corridor ([fig. 94](#fig.-94)), once thought to represent the entrance to his studio, affords a vivid picture of the flows in and out of this transitional space: pictures being moved out from studios or stores, a woman poised on the threshold of the private, about to step in. In the depths, a group of loiterers take up residence. Light reaches the space from a distance, through contiguous spaces. Momentarily brightened by the opening of a door, its natural state is half shadow even in the daylight hours.

According to the Bâtiments’ archives, the propriety of the passages at the Louvre was regularly under threat. In December 1777, the cleanliness, rather than the lighting, of the passages led to the intervention of the comte d’Angiviller, Marigny’s successor as director, into the trivialities of the everyday.[^17] The now so-called corridors, were supposed to be swept once every two weeks and sprinkled with water to settle the dust, but notwithstanding the conscientiousness of the cleaner, the place was, reported Jean-Baptiste-Marie Pierre, the king’s first painter, unacceptably filthy.[^18] D’Angiviller took up the matter with Barthouil, Inspecteur du Louvre, from whom he learned that art students habitually used the corridors as latrines and, moreover, that when Barthouil had instructed the Swiss guard to stop them defecating, he had been treated to a generous portion of their wastes on his doorstep in retaliation.[^19] Lighting was an important weapon in repressing such behavior. If it did not shame the student cohort, it did enable the identification of individual culprits.[^20]

Tensions arose not only between young and old for definition of the culture of the public space at the Louvre—wild or civilized, dark or light—but also between bachelors and married academicians. D’Angiviller touched on the inconveniences caused by absent single artists, because there was no wife to open the door to receive messages, no one to answer for and to them.[^21] This suggests that bachelor households were potentially dangerous to order and decency too. Were bachelors perhaps the ones who threated not to pay the lantern charge? It is a point to note that the majority of the signatories of the petition were married men: Chardin, Desportes, Lemoyne, Pigalle, Vernet, and Vien. That the Louvre was no place for a woman is intimated by the case of Anne Vallayer-Coster, the only woman artist to have been granted a *logement* at the *galerie du Louvre*, a grace she appears to have hesitated in accepting.[^22] When in April 1779 she came for a site visit to inspect the rooms that d’Angiviller had assigned her and to establish whether she could in fact live there “honorably” and “comfortably,” she came “in the greatest . . . incognito” that a large “*calèche bonnet*” could afford, one so profound, according to the architect Maximilian Brébion, not a little impressed, that it “left the curious in some doubt as to whether the wearer possessed a face at all.”[^23] The passage-cum-gallery ideal that Lemoyne and company were bent upon preserving as a reality in 1769 was one in which riotous and sometimes rebellious masculinity was tamed by lantern light, and women like Mme Desportes and Vallayer-Coster, were free to circulate and pursue their domestic and working lives without cover and without risking mockery and shame.

The later context of the Bâtiments’ role under d’Angiviller in disciplining behavior at the Louvre could suggest, reading back, that the lanterns of 1769 were in practice Marigny’s things, though they belonged to Lemoyne and his *logement* neighbors. Marigny’s regime was notably less oppressive that d’Angiviller’s. Even so, the petitioners’ concern for decency certainly suggests that the artists at the Louvre were subjects of what Michel Foucault has called “biopower,” unconsciously internalising norms of behavior and self-control useful to the state and which, by use of lanterns, they themselves intended to perpetuate.[^24] Yet their attachment to the lanterns exceeded the merely instrumental. In calling the mezzanine corridor a “gallery” and by invoking custom, their petition indicates that they valued lantern light also for its symbolic meaning. It styled their manner of existence “privileged” in contrast to the artisanal neighborhoods of Paris, where lanterns oriented passage at night rather than illuminate it.[^25] Privilege lived entailed responsibilities as well as representation. The Louvre artists, the petition has suggested, were a community conscious of its interdependence. Defending the custom of lighting was also defending the right of the lesser artists to little jobs. It articulated a concern to mitigate the social and cultural differences within privilege between the haves and the have-nots, between students and elders, between men and women, between bachelors and married men, and ensure thereby the better security for all. If we would be mistaken in raising the coincidental connection here between lanterns, light, and social solidarity to the metaphorical level of Enlightenment it is, perhaps, no coincidence that the phalanstery imagined by Charles Fourier and other utopians in the nineteenth century was informed, as Roger Luckhurst has recently shown, by the “corridic” (his word) spaces of the Louvre and other royal palaces.[^26] The collectively owned lantern in the public corridor embodies a different strand of modernity’s myth of artistic genius, one rooted not in the isolated individual studio but in community, and manifest in such housing projects as La Ruche, the artist community established by the sculptor Alfred Boucher at Montparnasse in the wake of the Great Exhibition of 1900, and which is still home to around fifty artists today. {% contributors context=pageContributors format='symbol' %}
